## MVI
Use some deep learning methods to predict whether a patient has mvi.  
<br/>
Nowadays doctors only use pathological slices to see whether a patient has mvi, but only after the surgery doctors can get the pathological slices.  
<br/>
We want to use some deep learning methods to predict the mvi using MRI images, that is to say, doctors can konw whether a patient has mvi before the surgery, so during the surgery, they can take some actions like cutting a little more area around the liver leision, so that the patient may get more chance to survive after the surgery.
